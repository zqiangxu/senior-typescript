The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (BEM) is a popular naming convention for classes in CSS.

For example, the block component would be represented as btn, element that depends upon the block would be represented as btn**price, modifier that changes the style of the block would be represented as btn--big or btn**price--warning.

Implement BEM<B, E, M> which generate string union from these three parameters. Where B is a string literal, E and M are string arrays (can be empty).
